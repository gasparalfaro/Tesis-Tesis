Here are the main conclusions of this thesis:

\begin{itemize}

\item When investing among peers, unstability in the returns hinders cooperation. The delayed punishment of defectors also makes defectors thrive.

\item Analyzing evolutionary games, even though the system is stable, the local dynamics can be unstable. We obtained a method to study the complexity of this interactions through the study of the divergence of the Hamming distance of two initially close configurations.

\item We correctly classified all elementary cellular automata with the Hamming distance measure of diverging configurations. Class $4$ presents transitory chaos underlying the phenomenon of edge of chaos.

\item Through the control partial analysis we obtained a useful tool in game theory. This tools helps players make decisions even when information is not complete.

\end{itemize}
